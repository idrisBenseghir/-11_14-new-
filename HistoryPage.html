                <h3>The birth of 'global warming'</h3>
                <p>In a report called "Restoring the Quality of Our Environment", the scientists proposed that increasing temperatures in the atmosphere were caused by a buildup of carbon dioxide. But it wasn’t until 1975 that the term “global warming” was coined by geoscientist Wallace Broecker — and it took years before the issue reached mainstream understanding.</p>

                <h3>Earth Day</h3>
                <p>The organisers wanted to raise awareness of concerns such as pollution and toxic waste and were inspired by the anti-war movement led by students at the time, according to its website. Earth Day has now become a global event ever since 1990, when 200 million people in 141 countries joined forces to bring it to the world stage.</p>
