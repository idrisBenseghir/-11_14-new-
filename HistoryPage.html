                <h1> History </h1>
                <h3>The birth of 'global warming'</h3>
                <p>In a report called "Restoring the Quality of Our Environment", the scientists proposed that increasing temperatures in the atmosphere were caused by a buildup of carbon dioxide. But it wasn’t until 1975 that the term “global warming” was coined by geoscientist Wallace Broecker — and it took years before the issue reached mainstream understanding.</p>

            <section>
                <h3>Earth Day</h3>
                <p>The organisers wanted to raise awareness of concerns such as pollution and toxic waste and were inspired by the anti-war movement led by students at the time, according to its website. Earth Day has now become a global event ever since 1990, when 200 million people in 141 countries joined forces to bring it to the world stage.</p>

                <h3>Heatwaves</h3>
                <p>By the late 1980s, droughts and record heat led to media coverage around the world, with the LA Times, for example, reporting in 1989 on British scientists' discovery that the previous year had been the hottest ever on record — and crucially, linked this rising heat level to "global warming."</p>

                <h3>The IPCC</h3>
                <p>In 1988, the UN launched its Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). The expert panel was given the job of assessing the developing science on climate change and providing up-to-date information to governments.</p>

                <h3>Demonstrations</h3>
                <p>Between 2000 and 2019, nine of the hottest years ever recorded took place, but fossil fuel consumption was still rising ever higher. It led to the founding of international pressure groups.</p>
